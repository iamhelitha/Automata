# Automata

An Android automation framework that compares ride prices across multiple ride-hailing apps in real-time and books the best option — all without touching a single API.

Built entirely with **Accessibility Services** and **on-device OCR**, Automata interacts with ride-hailing apps the same way a human would: by reading the screen, tapping buttons, and making decisions.

> **Disclaimer:** This is an educational project built to explore Android accessibility services, on-device OCR, and cross-app automation. It is not intended for commercial use or distribution. Use responsibly and at your own risk.

## What It Does

1. **Opens ride-hailing apps** (PickMe, Uber) one by one
2. **Enters your destination** and navigates to the pricing screen
3. **Reads prices using OCR** (ML Kit text recognition on screenshots)
4. **Compares prices** (or ETAs) and picks the best option
5. **Books the winning ride** automatically
6. **Shows results** via a floating overlay and notification

All of this happens in about 30–60 seconds with no manual input after you tap "Go".

## How It Works

Automata doesn't use any ride-hailing APIs. Instead, it uses two Android system features:

### Accessibility Service
Android's AccessibilityService gives apps the ability to observe and interact with the UI of other apps. Automata uses this to:
- Read UI element text and properties
- Tap buttons, enter text, scroll, and navigate
- Detect which screen is currently displayed

### On-Device OCR
Some apps (especially Flutter-based ones) don't expose useful text through accessibility nodes. For these, Automata takes a screenshot and runs **ML Kit Text Recognition** locally on the device to read prices, labels, and buttons directly from the screen pixels.

### Step-Based Automation Engine
Every automation task is broken down into a sequence of **steps**. Each step has:
- A **wait condition** — polls the accessibility tree until the expected screen appears
- An **action** — what to do once the condition is met (tap, read, enter text)
- **Timeout and retry logic** — handles slow loading, unexpected popups, and errors

```
Force-close apps
    → Launch PickMe → Enter destination → Read price
    → Launch Uber → Enter destination → Read price
    → Compare prices → Pick winner
    → Re-open winner → Book the ride
```

### Key Components

| Component | What it does |
|---|---|
| **AutomationEngine** | Manages the step sequencer, app lifecycle, and accessibility integration |
| **StepSequencer** | Executes steps sequentially with polling, timeouts, and retries |
| **ActionExecutor** | Low-level gestures — tap, type, scroll, press home/back |
| **ScreenReader** | Takes screenshots and runs OCR to extract text and positions |
| **NodeFinder** | Traverses the accessibility tree to find UI elements |
| **RideOrchestrator** | Composes app-specific scripts into a full comparison workflow |
| **PickMeScript / UberScript** | App-specific step sequences for navigating each ride app |

### Data Flow

```
User taps "Go"
    → ViewModel validates config (destination, network, apps installed)
    → RideOrchestrator builds step list from TaskConfig
    → AutomationEngine runs steps via StepSequencer
    → Each step polls accessibility tree → executes action → returns result
    → Collected data (prices, ETAs) flows through StepContext
    → Orchestrator compares and decides winner
    → Conditional booking steps run for the winning app only
    → Result shown via overlay + notification
```

- **Two decision modes** — Cheapest (lowest price) or Fastest (shortest ETA)
- **Automatic booking** — books the winning ride without manual intervention
- **Floating control overlay** — always-visible timer and stop button during automation
- **Price comparison popup** — overlay showing both prices and savings
- **OCR price sanitization** — handles comma-as-period misreads, dropped decimals
- **Conditional booking** — only the winning app's booking steps execute
- **Saved tasks** — store destination/pickup/preferences for one-tap automation
- **Settings** — configurable overlay duration, notification sound, auto-close apps, debug mode

## Challenges and Learnings

Building this project involved solving several non-trivial problems:

- **Flutter apps and accessibility** — PickMe is built with Flutter, which has limited accessibility node support. OCR-based coordinate tapping was the only reliable way to interact with it.
- **OCR accuracy** — Commas read as periods (`7,733` → `7.733`), missing decimals, and digit misreads (`l` → `1`, `O` → `0`) required a multi-layered sanitization pipeline.
- **Cross-app state management** — Passing data (prices, winner decision) across steps that span two different apps, with the automation engine as the only shared context.
- **Overlay permissions** — `TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY` lets you draw over other apps without requesting `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`, but touch handling (touchable vs pass-through) needs careful flag management.
- **Timing and reliability** — Apps load at different speeds, popups appear unpredictably, and UI layouts change between updates. The polling + retry + timeout pattern handles this gracefully.

## Installation

### Download the APK

1. Go to the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Download the latest `automata-v*.apk` file
3. Transfer the APK to your Android device (or download directly on the device)
4. Open the APK file on your device
   - If prompted, allow installation from unknown sources: **Settings → Apps → Special access → Install unknown apps** → enable for your browser or file manager
5. Tap **Install**

### Troubleshooting Installation

Installing apps from outside the Play Store triggers several Android security features. Here's how to get past them:

#### 1. Google Play Protect blocks the install

Google Play Protect may flag the APK as unverified and block installation.

**Fix:**
1. Open the **Google Play Store** app
2. Tap your **profile icon** (top right) → **Play Protect**
3. Tap the **gear icon** (top right)
4. Turn off **Scan apps with Play Protect**
5. Install the APK, then re-enable Play Protect afterwards

#### 2. Samsung Auto Blocker prevents installation (Samsung devices)

Samsung devices have an additional security feature called **Auto Blocker** that blocks sideloaded apps.

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Settings → Security and privacy → Auto Blocker**
2. Turn it **off**
3. Install the APK, then re-enable it afterwards

#### 3. Accessibility service option is greyed out

Android restricts sideloaded apps from using accessibility services by default. You need to allow restricted settings first.

**Fix:**
1. Go to **Settings → Apps**
2. Find and tap **Automata**
3. Tap the **three-dot menu** (top right corner)
4. Tap **Allow restricted settings**
5. You may need to confirm with your PIN, pattern, or fingerprint
6. Now go to **Settings → Accessibility → Automata** and turn it on

> These restrictions exist because accessibility services have deep access to your device. They apply to all sideloaded apps, not just Automata.

### Build from Source

If you prefer to build it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayathuc/Automata.git
cd Automata
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Transfer it to your device and install.

> **Requirements:** Android Studio, JDK 11+, Android SDK 26+

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android 8.0 or higher
- Both **PickMe** and **Uber** must be installed and logged in on the device

### First-Time Setup

1. **Open Automata** after installing
2. **Enable the accessibility service** — the app will prompt you. Go to **Settings → Accessibility → Automata** and turn it on
3. **Grant notification permission** when prompted (Android 13+)

### Using the App

1. **Create a task** — tap the + button and enter:
   - Destination address (as you'd type it in the ride app)
   - Pickup address (optional — uses current location if left empty)
   - Which apps to compare (PickMe, Uber, or both)
   - Decision mode: **Cheapest** or **Fastest**
2. **Tap "Go"** on your saved task
3. **Switch to your home screen** — Automata will take over from here
4. **Watch it work** — a floating pill shows elapsed time and a stop button
5. **See results** — a popup overlay shows the price comparison and which app was booked

### Settings

Open Settings from the top bar to configure:

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| Auto-enable location | Turns on GPS automatically if it's off when automation starts |
| Auto-bypass "someone else" prompt | Automatically taps "No, it's for me" if Uber asks |
| Show comparison overlay | Floating card showing both prices after comparison |
| Overlay duration | How long the comparison popup stays visible (5–15 seconds) |
| Notification sound | Play sound when results are ready |
| Auto-close apps | Close ride apps after booking is complete |
| Default decision mode | Cheapest or Fastest |
| Preferred app | Tiebreaker when both price and ETA are the same |

### Stopping a Running Automation

- Tap the **STOP** button on the floating pill (visible on any screen), or
- Open Automata and tap the stop button on the dashboard
